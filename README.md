# ranaji
RANA JI is a simple programme which respond automatically to queries of the citizens.
The response can be in the form of text or actions. “Our initial idea for Ranaji is focussed more on ‘thematic issues’ for example, what to do if user’s PAN CARD/Aadhar Card is lost, who is MLA/Mayor of his/her constituency, documents required for applying for a new passport,voter ID etc., how he/she can change his Passport/Aadhar Card details, conducting feedback from the citizens on various policies, finding out the weather, finding out available trains/flights to Rajasthan or upcoming events in Rajasthan. The number and types of actions are limitless.

It can also help visitors to find contact details for any civil servant of his/her constituency related to his/her queries.
It can allow citizens report concerns like dirty streets, or policies issues on topics such as pension or Bhamashah Yojna.
